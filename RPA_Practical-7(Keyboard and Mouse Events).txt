Practical 7 – Keyboard and Mouse Events in UiPath

a. Demonstrate Mouse and Keyboard Activities**

i. Mouse Events (Click, Double Click, Hover)**

1. **Click**:
   - Use the **Click** activity.
   - Indicate a button or UI element (e.g., Start Menu icon or browser tab).

2. **Double Click**:
   - Use **Double Click** activity.
   - Indicate a file or folder.

3. **Hover**:
   - Use **Hover** activity.
   - Indicate a menu item to simulate mouse hover (useful for dropdowns).

ii. Type Into**

- Use **Type Into** activity.
- Example: Open Notepad and type:
  ```vb
  "This is a 'Type Into' demo"
  ```

iii. Type Secure Text**

- Use **Get Secure Credential** (from Windows Credential Manager or Asset).
- Use **Type Secure Text** activity.
- Input: the secure string (e.g., for password fields in login forms).


b. Demonstrate Triggering Events**

i. Element Triggering Event**

- Use **Monitor Events** → **Element Trigger**
- Example:
  1. Use **Element Trigger** to watch for a pop-up or new window.
  2. Add a handler (e.g., click “OK” or log event).

ii. Image Triggering Event**

- Use **Image Trigger** inside **Monitor Events**
- Example:
  1. Indicate a logo or warning icon.
  2. When the image appears, show a **Message Box**.

iii. System Triggering Event**

- Use **System Trigger** activity (from **UiPath.System.Activities** package)
- Supported events: keyboard hotkey, mouse click, or file change
- Example:
  - Trigger bot when `Ctrl + Shift + L` is pressed.


c. Automate Launching Assistant Bot on Keyboard Event**

Objective:** Launch a bot when a specific key is pressed (e.g., `Ctrl + Alt + R`)

Steps:**
1. Create a **Trigger Scope** activity.
2. Inside it, use **Key Press Trigger**:
   - Hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + R`
3. Inside the trigger, perform desired actions:
   - **Open Notepad**, **Type Into**, or **Show Message Box**.

Example Actions in Trigger:**
- Start Process: `"notepad.exe"`
- Type Into: `"Assistant Bot triggered by keyboard!"`


These features are especially useful for attended bots or assistant bots that react to system events.
