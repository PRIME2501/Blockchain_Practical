6 Different controls in UiPath: 
a. Implement the attach window activity.  
b. Automate using Anchor Base.  
c. Automate using Element Exists. 
d. Automate using Find Children control.  
e. Use Get Ancestor control  
f. Use Find Relative control  

Steps:
Different controls in UiPath: 
6a. Implement the attach window activity.(attach window is now replace with use 
Application/Browser) 
Step-1: click on Process 
Step-2: Give name to the practical and click on create 
Step-3: To create an use Application/Browser activity perform the steps as follows 
a) First make an flow chart 
b) Then make an sequence box 
c) Inside sequence box make an use application/Browser activity  
d) Then click on indicate application to automate (click on blank notepad) 
e) There is an Do option in the use application/browser activity, drag an untitled notepad 
f) Write the content in type this option (“Automating through uipath”) 
g) Click on debug file then the notepad will be open by automation and the text will be written by automation as Automating through uipath. 

6b. Automate using Anchor Base. (Anchor base is updated in advance from as  use Application/Browser) 
Input: follow same steps as practical 5a and add find element option for finding the search address in web browser example 
Output: we are getting an output of automation typing in browser and searching the search option in chrome by find element option 

6c. Automate using Element Exists. (Element exists activity is been updated by check app state) 
Step-1: use the website https://rpachallenge.com/ for automation 
Step-2: click on Process 
Step-3: Give name to the practical and click on create 
Step-4: follow the image for giving the sequence and functionality to check app state automation. 
Step-6: click on debug file and see the use application/browser and check app state automation. 
a) First it goes to start > Round1 
b) It types the address as Mulund college of commerce 
c) Then click on submit button 
d) If target does not appears it shows the same loop of point a) to c). 
Step-7: see the work flow of automation step by step in image 

6d. Automate using Find Children control. 
Step-1: use website” https://acme-test.uipath.com/vendors/inventory/” 
Step-2: 
Step-3: Blanks are inventory code which are not displayed because of security reasons. 
5e. Use Get Ancestor control 
Step-1: 
Step-2: 
Step-3: Debug file 

6f. Use Find Relative control 
Step-1: 
Step-2: 
Step-3:

RPA Practical 6: Working with Different Controls in UiPath, covering each activity with simple examples and explanations.

Practical 6 – Different Controls in UiPath

a. Implement the Attach Window Activity**

Objective:** Work within a specific window (e.g., Notepad, Calculator) to scope activities.

Example: Automate text entry in Notepad**

Steps:**
1. Open Notepad manually.
2. In UiPath, drag **Attach Window** activity.
3. Indicate the Notepad window.
4. Inside it, add a **Type Into** activity:
   ```vb
   "This is typed inside the attached Notepad window"
   ```


b. Automate Using Anchor Base**

Objective:** Use an anchor element to locate dynamic or shifting UI elements.

Example: Fill username field where label location may vary**

Steps:**
1. Drag **Anchor Base** activity.
2. In **Anchor** section → Add **Find Element** (e.g., label "Username")
3. In **Action** section → Add **Type Into** (target input field)
   - Text: `"JohnDoe"`

Useful when labels are fixed but input fields are variable.**


c. Automate Using Element Exists**

Objective:** Detect if an element is present (returns Boolean).

Example: Check if a pop-up window appears**

Steps:**
1. Use **Element Exists**
2. Indicate the pop-up (e.g., Save dialog)
3. Output → `exists` (Boolean)
4. Add an **If** activity:
   - Condition: `exists = True`
   - Then: Add a Message Box: `"Pop-up exists"`


d. Automate Using Find Children Control**

Objective:** Get a list of UI elements within a parent (e.g., list items in a menu).

Steps:**
1. Use **Find Children** → Indicate parent element (like a list box or menu)
2. Output → `children` (IEnumerable<UiElement>)
3. Use **For Each** loop:
   - TypeArgument: `UiElement`
   - Action: Use **Get Attribute** or **Get Text** to extract item details


e. Use Get Ancestor Control**

Objective:** Get the parent or ancestor of a UI element.

Example:** Click the panel or section that contains a label.

Steps:**
1. Use **Find Element** to get a specific label.
2. Use **Get Ancestor** → Pass the element as input
3. Output: ancestor UiElement (e.g., surrounding panel)
4. Optionally perform actions like highlighting or clicking ancestor.


f. Use Find Relative Control**

Objective:** Identify an element in relation to another (e.g., text box next to a label).

Steps:**
1. Use **Find Element** → Identify the reference (e.g., label "Email")
2. Use **Find Relative Element** → Find the textbox next to it
3. Use **Type Into** to enter email address.
